# CARLA based Visualizer

This script helps in quickly visualizing your planning and control algorithm solution for autonomous vehicles. It is possible to pass reference trajectories for multiple vehicles, which is tracked by the internal PID controller of each vehicle.

This works with CARLA 0.9.X. Sample reference trajectories are provided for a scenario involving lane change problem of two autonomous cars. Save the script and the reference trajectories in the CARLA PythonAPI folder.
